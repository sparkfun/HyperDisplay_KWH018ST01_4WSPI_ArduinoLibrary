/*

This is a configuration file for the hyperdisplay library

The purpose is to customize the instance of the library
for the particular needs of the application. For example
on a small system the size of included code is a concern
and so fewer optional items would be included. On a larger
system however more advanced features may be desired, and
they will require additional inclusions
